Bank Reconciliation â€“ Expert Content (ICAI, Blogs, YouTube)

1. As per ICAI guidelines, every reconciliation statement should clearly identify the period covered and the sources of data (ICAI, Guidance Note on Bank Reconciliation).
2. Always match the opening balances of the bank statement and the books before starting reconciliation (ICAI).
3. Common reasons for mismatches include: outstanding cheques, direct credits/debits by the bank, bank charges, and errors in recording (ICAI, AccountingTools Blog).
4. Use a step-by-step approach: (a) Tick matched items, (b) List unmatched items, (c) Investigate discrepancies, (d) Pass necessary journal entries (YouTube: CA Ravi Taori, "Bank Reconciliation Statement").
5. For large volumes, use automated tools or scripts to speed up matching and reduce manual errors (AccountingTools Blog, YouTube: FinTech Academy).
6. Always document the reasons for each unreconciled item for audit trail and future reference (ICAI).
7. Regular reconciliation (monthly or more frequent) is recommended to detect fraud and errors early (ICAI, Blogs).
